# canbus-brake-controller
Premise: Some vehicles have a way to physically attach a trailer but don't have the wiring present control the brake/turn lights. Since many vehicles use canbus to connect the various electronic subsystems, it may be possible to sniff the required brake-light and turn-signal statuses from the canbus and transmit the state (out of band) to a remote trailer light controller.
